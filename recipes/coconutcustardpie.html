    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>If you're already a custard lover, then you undoubtedly already understand that the differences between custard and pudding are so significant, 
        that it's almost mind-boggling how many people seem to use the terms interchangeably. Custard is thickened with eggs, and pudding is thickened 
        with starch (such as flour, cornstarch, rice, or tapioca). As a direct result, custard has a slick mouthfeel and is almost semi-solid, whereas 
        pudding has a velvety mouthfeel and a softer consistency, as recipe developer Miriam Hahn puts it. Hahn's recipe for coconut custard pie is a 
        celebration of custard's elegant simplicity, and it appears that Hahn has increasingly come to appreciate this divine fact as she has come to 
        know her mother-in-law over the years.</p>
    <p>"My mother-in-law is a huge dessert pie person. So, we visit her a lot, and I like to bring her sweet treats," says Hahn, whose mother-in-law
        knows the difference between a coconut "cream" pie and a coconut custard pie and would always choose the latter over the former. And that brings us
        to this lovely recipe for coconut custard pie.
